# Discrete-Event-Infection-Spread-Simulator
Steps to run the simulator:
- first compile the simulator (g++ simulator.cpp -o simulator)
- Then run simulator(./simulator) on the terminal which will create two files infection_distance.csv and time_stats.csv respectively contain data about a infected person VS how many people passed the infection from source before he got infected and a infected person VS time he got infected.
